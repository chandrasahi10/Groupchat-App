# Groupchat-App
The simple and small group chat app project utilizes Node.js and Express to create a server-side application. It leverages the browser's local storage to store usernames, enabling users to identify themselves in the chat.

Additionally, the app employs the OS filesystem to store and retrieve messages, facilitating real-time communication and demonstrating the practical application of Node.js and Express for building interactive web applications.
