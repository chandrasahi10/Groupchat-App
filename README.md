# Groupchat-App
The simple and small group chat app project utilizes Node.js and Express to create a server-side application. It leverages the browser's local storage to store usernames, enabling users to identify themselves in the chat.

Additionally, the app employs the OS filesystem to store and retrieve messages, facilitating real-time communication and demonstrating the practical application of Node.js and Express for building interactive web applications.

### Features :
- Simple chat application using basic HTML, Express.js, and Node.js for real-time communication between two users.
- User-friendly interface with a clean and intuitive design.
- Supports seamless real-time messaging between two users, enabling instant communication.
- Utilizes local storage to store the username, ensuring a personalized experience for each user across sessions.
- Messages are persistently stored using the OS filesystem, ensuring that conversations are retained even after server restarts.
- Robust server-side implementation using Node.js and Express.js, providing a stable and secure communication platform.

### My learning in this project :
